With cloud computing advances, more and more data is being stored in cloud storage. Deduplication
allows space savings for the cloud provider by storing only a single copy of repeating data.
Achieving this in a secure, privacy preserving way opens up several challenges. Traditional file-level deduplication allows space savings only when the files are identical to each other. In many scenarios, users upload files that are close to each other.
We discuss the construction of a secure deduplication scheme that enables deduplication not only for the files that are identical, but also for files that are close to one another under certain conditions\footnote{We divide the entire message space into codewords. Messages that come under the same codeword can be deduplicated easily}. We put forward a construction and proves its correctness and security.
