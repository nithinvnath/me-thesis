\chapter{Conclusion and Future Works}
\label{chap:future}

We have put forward a scheme called $\scheme$ that enables deduplication across files and have proved its soundness and privacy. We are able to save space by only storing the ``delta" between two files that are close to each other and maps to the same codeword.
\\ \\
\noindent
As part of the future work, the scheme can be implemented to test real world space savings and efficiency.
Incorporating the properties of Fuzzy extractors \cite{fuzzy} to this is both a challenging and interesting future work.
